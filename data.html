        <h4>Personal Profile</h4>
        <p class="pt-2 pb-3">
          I personally do not put much stock in these online tests, as I do not
          believe they are entirely accurate and nothing is stopping you
          cherry-picking your answers to manipulate the outcome; however, they
          can be fun to do with friends or fellow employeeâ€™s.<br /><br />
          In these tests, I answered as truthfully without sugar-coating it. So,
          I could get an accurate result am I do recognize some of the traits
          pointed out, in the three selected tests.
        </p>

        <h6>Personality Test:</h6>
        <p class="pt-2 pb-3">
          The results from the personality test were interesting to me as I
          quite enjoy overseeing projects and building up the confidence of my
          team or work colleagues to get the best outcome. Charisma and
          confidence; when I am talking about a project or work presentation, I
          am fine, but if it's just meeting new people, I am lousy and
          awkward.<br /><br />
          I am well driven and determined to achieve any goals that have been
          set for me, but I would not say I have a ruthless level of
          rationality.<br /><br />
          I agree with the remainder of the explanations of my personality type
          listed.
        </p>

        <h6>Creativity Test:</h6>
        <p class="pt-2 pb-3">
          I somewhat agree with this test as I do not see myself as overly
          creative in a visual sense as in drawing or design; however, I am
          quite good at coming up with creative ways to overcome complex
          technical and/or design issues.

        </div>

        <h6>Learning Style:</h6>
        <p class="pt-2 pb-3">
          This test pointed out that I am a visual learning which I most
          definitely am. I would rather see examples or be shown on how to
          accomplish the task, rather than someone talk on and on for an hour or
          so, our class-wide seminars. I find extremely boring and lacking
          substance to keep my attention.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-2">
          I also like to learn by pulling things apart be it equipment or source
          code to understand how its work and its design as I find that a great
          learning tool for electronics and programming.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-2">
          Once shown I can normally rinse and repeat with no issue.
